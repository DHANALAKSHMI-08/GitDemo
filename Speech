Good morning everyone,
When you look at this girl surrounded by flowers — do you see a crown or a cage?
What if I told you… it could be both?
Let me start with a kutty story . 
When a baby boy is born, people in the family whisper with joy, “A king is born!”
But when a baby girl is born, they whisper softly, “A princess is born…”
Sounds lovely, right? But do you know? That’s where the difference begins.
A king is expected to rule, to lead, to dream big. A princess? She is expected to be gentle, quiet, and obedient.
This is how a girl’s journey starts — wrapped in expectations, restrictions, and rules.
From dowry demands to family pressure…
From society’s fears to deep insecurities…
A girl’s life is caged even before she learns to spread her wings.
And it’s not an ordinary cage —
It’s a golden cage, like a shining ornament that looks precious but weighs her down,
Holding her dreams captive before they even take flight.
But here’s the truth.
The same girl, given the right support, can break those walls and reach for the stars!
Take Ritu Karidhal, the brilliant scientist who became the Mission Director for Chandrayaan-3 — India’s proud lunar mission. She is one of the inspiring Rocket Women of India — women who are breaking barriers, designing missions, and taking the country to new heights. These women prove that when given opportunities, a girl can lead rockets, explore space, and make her mark in the world.
So what does a girl really need?
•	Not jewellery that sparkles for a day — but education that empowers for a lifetime.
•	Not rules that confine — but freedom to choose her own path.
•	Not silence born from fear — but courage to dream without limits.
•	Not pity that weakens — but support that lifts her higher.
Let’s build crowns, not golden cages.
So let’s not just clap for her success — let’s be the reason she succeeds.
Let’s be the wind beneath her wings.
Because when we stand by a girl, when we give her the strength to stand tall…
We’re not just helping one person —
We’re empowering an entire generation to believe, to dream, and to shine.
Thank you.
